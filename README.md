# Exercise 3: what?

Dear [IM 215/CIS 215](http://phiffer.org/scripting/) student,

Welcome to exercise number three! The exercise this week will be slightly different, compared to what we’ve done up until now. We are going to focus more on *writing* and less on technology.

1. Fork this repository (look up in the top right corner of the page)
2. You should end up at a URL that begins github.com/__usename__, where __username__ is *your* username, not “dphiffer.”
3. Click on the file `what.html`
4. You should see a little pencil icon, when you hover over it it should say "Edit this file," __click the pencil icon__.
5. Edit the HTML:  
	* Replace the placeholder text “Lorem ipsum...” with your own essay, responding to the prompt: “i never thought i’d [____], but then...”
	* Replace the title inside the `<h1>...</h1>` with an appropriate title.
	* Make sure the total amount of text is *less than 2000* characters (you can check using an [online tool](http://www.charactercountonline.com/)).
6. Once you’re happy with your text, scroll down the page, enter a short commit description, and then click the __Commit changes__ button.
7. Go back to the main repository page and click the __Download ZIP__ button to get a local copy of your files.
8. Unzip the archive and open `what.html` in a web browser (File &rarr; Open).
9. Print the page, as well as this assignment page.
10. Make an appointment at the [Bradley Writing Center](http://www.bradley.edu/academic/departments/english/groups/writing/)
11. Bring your printed pages to your appointment, ask for feedback on your text.
12. Make additional edits to your text based on the feedback (follow steps 3–6 above).
